                    Points Coordination System (Points CS) is a project that aims to empower occupational therapists and their patients by giving them tools to teach and learn coordination in a fun, affordable, and effective way.<br><br>
                    The project is based on Points Notation, a way of writing movement invented by us. Using this easily learnable notation you'll have both access to an infinite variety of moves and to a clear idea of how to organize them depending on your patient's needs and wants.<br><br>
                    Because we want Points to arrive to as many people as possible, we've made it highly adaptable. There's no need for special objects, screens, or spaces: all you need is a couple of lessons (which can be taken online) and our cards (which you can even download and print by yourself if the expedition of the material is a problem).<br><br>
                    We want to help you help.<br>
                    Let's do it.<br>
                    Point!</p></div>

                    <b>Objective:</b><br>
                    We'll teach you the notation and the method. We'll then guide you through the creation of a
                    program specially tailored to your target audience and help you implement it.<br><br>
                    <b>Duration:</b> 6 hours of lessons (four sessions of 1h30m each) + homework.<br>
                    Cost: 150€ (discount available for group lessons)<br>
                    What you'll get:<br>
                    Understanding of how to read and create Points' sequences
                    Lifetime access to all the material
                    Your own personalized program<br><br>
                    <b>Program:</b><br>
                    First session – How to read Points Notation<br>
                    Second session – How to create your own sequences<br>
                    Third session – Creating a personalized program<br>
                    Fourth session – After you've implemented the program we'll discuss how
                    it went and make adjustments together.<br>
                    After this, you'll be able to write us a mail asking for advice for the next six months.<br><br>
