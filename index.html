                    <br>movement in a fun, cheap, and effective way.<br>
                    <br>The project is based on Points Notation, a way of writing movement invented by us. Using this
                    <br>easily learnable notation you'll have both access to an infinite variety of moves and to a clear idea
                    <br>of how to organize these moves depending on your patient's needs and wants.<br>
                    <br>Because we want Points to arrive to as many people as possible, we've made it highly adaptable.
                    <br>There's no need for special objects, screens or spaces: all you need is a couple of lessons (which
                    <br>can be taken online) and our Blocks (which you can even download and print by yourself if the
                    <br>expedition of the material is a problem).<br>
                    <br>We want to help you help.
                    <br>Let's do it.
